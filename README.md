Source-to-Image (S2I) is a open source project sponsored by Red Hat that has the following goal:

_OpenShift runs the S2I process inside a special Pod, called a Build Pod, and thus builds are subject to quotas, limits, resource scheduling, and other aspects of OpenShift._

I use [Single Node OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.9/installing/installing_sno/install-sno-installing-sno.html) (SNO) to demo the s2i tool, however, you can also run it [locally](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image). I have a video for [getting started with SNO](https://youtu.be/leJa9HmvdI0) if youâ€™re interested.

You can also [obtain a free developer sandbox at developers.redhat.com](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/get-started) to run the s2i demo
